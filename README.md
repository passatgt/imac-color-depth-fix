## imac-color-depth-fix

Simple macOS command line app to fix color depth issues after startup on oldal iMacs(09-11) with replaced GPUs(like 780M). Based on jakehilborn/displayplacer.

Usage: just simply run imaccolordepthfix. You can add it to your login items(system settings/users/login items), so it runs on a fresh startup automatically. If you have trouble running the app, check this out: https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer/issues/16
